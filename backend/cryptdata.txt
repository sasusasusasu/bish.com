Client registration:

1. Client creates RSA keypair
2. Client wraps PKCS#8 RSA private key with AES-KW
 -> wrapping key is generated from PBKDF2:
  - user's password as key material
  - 512-bit salt
  - 100k iterations
  - SHA-256 hashing
3. Client sends user data, public RSA key, PBKDF2 salt and the wrapped private key to the server
4. Server encrypts user data with public RSA key

Client login:

1. Server sends PBKDF2 salt and wrapped RSA private key to client
2. Client unwraps RSA private key with AES-KW and PBKDF2
3. Server encrypts a token with the requested client's public key
4. Client decrypts token, sends it back to server
5. If server's auth token matches the client's token:
6. Server sends encrypted user data to client and creates authorized session
